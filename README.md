These are some of the codes I've  been doing during my career at software development.  Most of the codes I want to upload are protected by a Privacy Policy, so, although I would like to show them, I canâ€™t.

gamblingGame:  The code is from an electronic betting game. It was made in Actionscript and flash cs6. You can watch the videos of the app here: https://goo.gl/JhXLIO.

drugstoreGame: A game for a drugstore laboratory, on which the user must match the illness to the drug/product designed to heal it. Made on flash cs6 and Actionscript. You can watch the videos of the app here: https://goo.gl/E7B9gm (the video has no sound because I captured it from quicktime).
 
drugstoreApp: Made with Symfony 1.4, an app for keeping track the user's weight. When the user registers he types his current condition and his goal, the system follows his weight and activities throughout a period of time until the user reaches his goal.

transferBank: An app made in Java with websphere using beans (mandatory uses) in order to make bank account transfers in the same bank.
