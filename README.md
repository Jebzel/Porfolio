# Porfolio

These are some of the codes I've  been doing during my career at software development.  Most of the codes I want to upload are protected by a Privacy Policy, so, although I would like to show them, I can't.

bootstrapPages: Web pages using bootstrap and jquery framework. The pages are in process to be implemented. You can see the home page <a href="http://goo.gl/Dv7ovK" target="_blank">here</a>.

cms: A small content manager system using bootstrap and jquery. You can see a example page <a href="http://goo.gl/ecpUXo" target="_blank">here</a>, and the structure of the site <a href="http://goo.gl/zGoe7p" target="_blank">here</a>. 

drugstoreApp: Made with Symfony 1.4, an app for keeping track the user's weight. When the user registers he types his current condition and his goal, the system follows his weight and activities throughout a period of time until the user reaches his goal.

drugstoreGame: A game for a drugstore laboratory, on which the user must match the illness to the drug/product designed to heal it. Made on flash cs6 and Actionscript. You can watch the video of the app  <a href="http://goo.gl/p2j8DJ" target="_blank">here</a> (the video has no sound because I captured it from quicktime).
 
drugstoreVisualAid: Visual aid made for Ipad in objective C. You can watch the video of the app <a href="http://goo.gl/QJHRON" target="_blank">here</a>.

elearning: E-learning series (almost 40 of them in total) made in Adobe Captivate. The last learnings had both a html and flash output, under scorm standard.

gamblingGame:  The code is from an electronic betting game. It was made in Actionscript and flash cs6. You can watch the videos of the app <a href="http://goo.gl/aZJXsM" target="_blank">here</a>.

transferBank: An app made in Java with websphere using beans (mandatory uses) in order to make bank account transfers in the same bank.
