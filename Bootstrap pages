        <p>Whether you operate a coffee shop, restaurant, leisure centre, caravan site or any other place where people meet either for leisure or business, your customers may well decide to visit you depending on whether your location has a hotspot.</p>
        <p>By providing a hotspot for your customers you will:</p>
        <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok Oobi-green" aria-hidden="true"></span> Win business over your competitors who don't provide Internet access </p>
        <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok Oobi-green" aria-hidden="true"></span> Level the playing field against those competitors already providing access </p>
        <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok Oobi-green" aria-hidden="true"></span> Generate a revenue stream by charging for the Internet access you provide </p>

        <hr>
        <p>Once our hotspot systems are installed at your site your customers can enjoy Internet access around the clock, 365 days a year. You don't need to change anything about the way your business operates - you don't even need to be present! Our intelligent access points take care of everything.</p>
        <p> When your customers switch on their wireless device they will automatically detect our access point network. They can then purchase Internet access time using our attractively priced tariffs. Payment is carried out online, using PayPal or credit/debit cards. It's a simple process and takes only a minute or so for your customers to be online and accessing the Internet through our high speed wireless network.</p>
        <p> A slice of the revenue from every transaction is automatically sent to you and you can use our online management system to track the financial performance of your site whenever you want.</p>
        <p> Support and assistance is available online for your customers and you can even customise our hotspot to provide useful information and announcements to your customers such as news, offers, events and promotions.</p>
        <p> The law requires that a record of your customers access is maintained. Our systems do this for you so that you can be confident you are offering a fully compliant service. </p>
